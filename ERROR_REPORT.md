# Android Build Error Report

## 1. Invalid SDK Version Configuration
**File:** `android/app/build.gradle`  
**Problem:** Invalid `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` values. Both are set to 36, which is not a valid Android SDK version.  
**Fix:**  
```groovy
android {
    compileSdk 34 // or 33 minimum
    
    defaultConfig {
        // ...
        targetSdk 34 // or 33 minimum
        // ...
    }
}
```

## 2. Kotlin Dependency Version Mismatch
**File:** `android/app/build.gradle`  
**Problem:** The Kotlin stdlib version (1.9.24) doesn't match with the Kotlin plugin version (2.1.0) in settings.gradle  
**Fix:**  
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.9.22" // Match with Kotlin plugin version
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

## 3. Commented Java Compatibility Settings
**File:** `android/build.gradle`  
**Problem:** Important Java compatibility settings are commented out in the root build.gradle  
**Fix:** Uncomment the Java compatibility settings:
```groovy
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
    afterEvaluate {
        if (project.hasProperty('android')) {
            android {
                compileOptions {
                    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
                    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
